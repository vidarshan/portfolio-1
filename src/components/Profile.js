                        Greetings! I’m Vidarshan and I am a <span className='underlined-text'>Passionate Software Engineer</span>, striving to make our day-to-day lives easier by building Software based Solutions.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I started my journey as a Software Engineer back in 2018, when I started reading for my <span className='underlined-text'>Bsc. in Software Engineering</span>.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        3 years later, here I am, a Software Engineering <span className='underlined-text'>Graduate</span> from <span className='underlined-text'>@Curtin University, Australia,</span> working as a <span className='underlined-text'>Trainee Software Engineer</span> at @BetaLaunch for almost 7 months working with React JS + Node JS.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Not only Programming is my Job, but it’s also my hobby, since <span className='underlined-text'>I enjoy every minute of me writing code,</span> and seeing things being built with each an every line of code I write.
