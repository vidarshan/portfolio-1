                    Greetings! I‚Äôm Vidarshan and I am a <span className='underlined-text'>Passionate Software Engineer</span>, striving to make our day-to-day lives easier by building Software based Solutions.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I started my journey as a Software Engineer back in 2018, when I started reading for my Bsc. in Software Engineering.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    3 years later, here I am, a Software Engineering Graduate from @Curtin University, Australia, working as a Trainee Software Engineer at @BetaLaunch for almost 7 months working with React JS + Node JS.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Not only Programming is my Job, but it‚Äôs also my hobby, since I enjoy every minute of me writing code, and seeing things being built with each an every line of code I write.
